Numbers

In JS, there is no separate integer type, so 1 and 1.0 are the same value.

If a number literal has an exponent part, then the value of the literal is computed by multiplying the part before the e by 10 raised to the power of the part after the e. So 100 and 1e2 are the same number.

Negative numbers can be formed by using the â€“ prefix operator.

The value NaN is a number value that is the result of an operation that cannot produce a normal result. NaN is not equal to any value, including itself. You can detect NaN with the isNaN(number) function.

The value Infinity represents all values greater than 1.79769313486231570e+308.

Numbers have methods:

JavaScript has a Math object that contains a set of methods that act on numbers. For example, the Math.floor(number) method can be used to convert a number into an integer by rounding down to the nearest whole number.

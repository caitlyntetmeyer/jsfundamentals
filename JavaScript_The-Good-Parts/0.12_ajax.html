	<h1>AJAX Introduction</h1>

	<h2>AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Update a web page without reloading the page</li>
		<li>Request data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
		<li>Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded</li>
		<li>Send data to a server - in the background</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What is AJAX?</h2>
	<p>AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.</p>
	<p>AJAX is not a programming language.</p>
	<p>AJAX just uses a combination of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)</li>
		<li>JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)</li>
	</ul>

	<p style="background-color: yellow">AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.</p>

	<p>AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>

	<h1>How AJAX Works</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)</li>
		<li>An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript</li>
		<li>The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server</li>
		<li>The server processes the request</li>
		<li>The server sends a response back to the web page</li>
		<li>The response is read by JavaScript</li>
		<li>Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript</li>
	</ol>

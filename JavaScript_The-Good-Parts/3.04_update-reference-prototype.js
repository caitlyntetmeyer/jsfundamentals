/*

UPDATE

A value in an object can be updated by assignment. If the property name already
exists in the object, the property value is replaced: */
stooge['first-name'] = 'Jerome';

/* If the object does not already have that property name, the object 
is augmented: */
stooge['middle-name'] = 'Lester';
stooge.nickname = 'Curly';
flight.equipment = {
 model: 'Boeing 777'
};
flight.status = 'overdue';

/*

REFERENCE

Objects are passed around by reference. They are never copied: */
var x = stooge;
x.nickname = 'Curly';
var nick = stooge.nickname;
 // nick is 'Curly' because x and stooge
 // are references to the same object
var a = {}, b = {}, c = {};
 // a, b, and c each refer to a
 // different empty object
a = b = c = {};
 // a, b, and c all refer to
 // the same empty object

/*

PROTOTYPE

Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit 
properties. All objects created from object literals are linked to 
Object.prototype, an object that comes standard with JavaScript.
When you make a new object, you can select the object that should be its 
prototype.
The mechanism that JavaScript provides to do this is messy and complex, 
but it can be significantly simplified. We will add a create method to 
the Object function. The create method creates a new object that uses an 
old object as its prototype. There will be much more about functions in 
the next chapter. */
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
 Object.create = function (o) {
 var F = function () {};
 F.prototype = o;
 return new F();
 };
}
var another_stooge = Object.create(stooge);
/* The prototype link has no effect on updating. When we make changes to 
an object, the objectâ€™s prototype is not touched: */
another_stooge['first-name'] = 'Harry';
another_stooge['middle-name'] = 'Moses';
another_stooge.nickname = 'Moe';

/* The prototype link is used only in retrieval. If we try to retrieve a 
property value from an object, and if the object lacks the property name, 
then JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the prototype 
object. And if that object is lacking the property, then it goes to its 
prototype, and so on until the process finally bottoms out with 
Object.prototype. If the desired property exists nowhere in the prototype 
chain, then the result is the undefined value. This is called delegation.
The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship. If we add a new 
property to a prototype, that property will immediately be visible in all 
of the objects that are based on that prototype: */
stooge.profession = 'actor';
another_stooge.profession // 'actor'

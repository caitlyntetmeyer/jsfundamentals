/* #3 Node.js video: The V8 Engine  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86tgU7UaJmU&index=3&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp

JavaScript Engines
-Computers don't understand JavaScript.
-A JavaScript engine takes JS and converts it into sth computers do understand: machine code.

Machine Code Diagram:
High-level: JavaScript (abstracted a lot away from machine code)
Next down: C++ (powerful)
Next down: Assembly Language (abstracted a little bit away from machine code)
Lowest-level: Machine Code (what computers understand - really hard for humans to understand)

So we need a way for JS to be converted into Machine Code.
Node.js is actually written in C++ - crazy, right? But as a program, it allows us to write JS that can run on a computer or server. Node.js uses the V8 JS engine by Google that's also written in C++.

In conclusion, at the heart of Node.js is the V8 engine, which converts our JS into machine code.

Net Ninja video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H63dVFDuJDM&index=32&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET

Use the DOM when we interact w/web pages:
1. Add content to an HTML document
2. Delete content from an HTML doc
3. Change content on an HTML doc

We can do this on the fly, as our web page is being loaded or viewed.

DOCUMENT: document - the web page; usu. an HTML document

OBJECT:
Objects are elements.

Examples of objects:
1. head tag
2. body tag
3. ul tag
4. p tag
5. span tag
6. div tag
7. a tag

We can call methods and properties on objects.
We can use objects to call methods on them to change them, delete them, add to them, etc.

MODEL:
Describes how the objects are laid out in a tree fashion.

NODES:
Everything we can change in the document

Examples of Nodes:
1. Elements are nodes
2. Text WITHIN elements are also separate nodes!
3. HTML attributes (ex: href, class, styles)

What We Can Do w/the DOM:
1. Change the <h1> text node at the top of the page
2. Change the background color of an element node
3. Animate the logo node (an image node) from left to right
4. Expand the height of an element node when you click on it (ex: "Click here to read more below")
5. Animations and validations
6. Plus much more!

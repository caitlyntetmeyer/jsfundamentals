JavaScript Libraries:
jQuery
MooTools (not quite as popular)
Modernizr (more to do w/keeping up w/browser standards)

AJAX:
essentially a part of JavaScript
Allows JS to communicate w/the server w/o having to leave the web page
Ex: When you zoom in on Google Maps

JSON:
JavaScript Object Notation
Way of organizing data; works well w/AJAX

More JavaScript:
Regular expressions & advanced validation (ex: make sure a user entered her email correctly instead of just some random word)
OOP (object oriented programming)
Projects with sliders, drag and drop, animated menus
